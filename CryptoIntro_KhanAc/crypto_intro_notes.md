## khan academy intro to cryptography series

- (4-7 short videos on the basics of cryptography)

#### intro to cryptography 

- alice locks message in a box and this is called encryption
- bob can open message with his key and this is called decryption
- eve can't read the message while in transmission



#### fundamental theorem of arithmetic

- 29 days for moon to complete rotation 
- 29 doesn't break down evenly - 14, 15 or 10, 10, 9

- eulem's spiral -> shows pattern of primes that goes on forever

- euclid figured out primes. and that they are the building blocks of all numbers (prime factors)


#### probability space

- cardano won bets based on mathematics 
- every outcome is equally likely 
- probability space: event over the sample space
- 1 dice: 6 outcomes
- 2 dice: 36 outcomes
- 3 dice: 216 outcomes


#### frequency stability

- 2 rooms with 1 switch 
- 1 room switch based on head or tails
- 2nd room based on random pattern by human judgement (leads to uneven patterns)
- can you figure out coin flip rooms?
	- yes: frequency stability due to equally likely outcomes


#### caesar cipher

- pre-agreed shift for alphabets: 
- receipient substract shift to decipher message

- can decipher by counting frequency in original text and figure how much it has shifted wrt sample text 


#### polyalphabetic cipher

- flatten frequench of words
- using multiple shifts instead of single shift (based on a pre agreed word)
- longer the shift word, the stronger the cipher

#### one time pad

- random shifts based on pre generated sequence almost as long as the message 
- strongest encryption: also known as one-time pad
