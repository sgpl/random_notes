# female founders conference

#### jessica livingston

- first all female conference in the startup world
- yc started up as a startup investment fund
- founded in march 2005 
- agreed to fund 8 startups
- book deal for founders at work 
- started with zero credentials when starting yc
- don't worry about qualifications and credentials
- need to have: 

- __founders must have a deep interest in (solving) the problem__
- __test a hypothesis and see if it sticks__
- servers and bandwith cheaper. press was cheaper to get on the net
- no background or prior knowledge of angel investing when starting
- first summer's program: 
	- funding startups in batches is very powerful
	- helpful to have a peer network to go through the same thing
- non-technical founder
	- everything that is not technical
	- groceries / events / delivered ACs / learned to incorporate cos. 
	- tried to get press / didn't get any 

- yc and all their startups grew through initial group of fanatical early adopters

- now: 632 startups / $20B market cap / 12 partners / etc. 
- goals still remain the same

1. determination 
2. withstand rejection // from investors, users, etc
3. empathy // talk to user, care about experience
4. make something people want // 
5. live cheaply/extend runway // to buy more runaway, because you have little money. run out of money == DIE
6. Focus. Focus. FOCUS. // easy to focus on the wrong things

##### advice for women

- easier to start a startup before you have kids
	- not sure if she would have done a startup if she had kids before yc
	- struggles to manage a lot of things
	- definitely possible
	- didn't want to work 12 hours a day after having kids
	- during yc worked 70-90 hours and worked 7 days a week
- it's OK to be the quiet founder // but quietly determined
- 34.5% female founders have SOs as their co-founders
- other stuff.
